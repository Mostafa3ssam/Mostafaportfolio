  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Junior .NET Developer focused on building clean, scalable web applications using C#, ASP.NET Core, Web API, and Entity Framework. I care about writing maintainable code, applying SOLID principles, and designing solutions that are easy to extend and test.
  </p>
  <p>
    I enjoy collaborating within teams, reviewing code, and breaking down problems into smaller, testable units. My interests include clean architecture, design patterns, and performance-aware data access with EF Core and LINQ. I'm motivated by continuous learning and delivering value with a pragmatic approach.
